# **Custom Knowledge ChatGPT with LangChain - Chat with PDFs**

0.   Installs, Imports and API Keys
1.   Loading PDFs and chunking with LangChain
2.   Embedding text and storing embeddings
3.   Creating retrieval function
4.   Creating chatbot with chat memory

Note: I have used a sample document file that is a research paper on "A RESEARCH ON CLOUD COMPUTING" by Benneth Chukwuemeka Uzoma and Isokpehi Bonaventure Okhuoya

Thanks to Liam Ottley for guiding through this project through his informative youtube video:
